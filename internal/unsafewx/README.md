# unsafewx

Package unsafewx provides management routines for memory that is either
writeable or executable. The "unsafe" part is there to remind you that any use
of unsafewx is unsafe, even though it typically doesn't require you to import
`unsafe` yourself.

Allocate a `Block` using `unsafewx.Alloc` or `unsafewx.MustAlloc`. The amount
of memory actually allocated is always rounded up to a multiple of the page
size. Blocks implement the `io` interfaces `Writer` to write machine code to
the block, `WriterTo` to copy out the contents of the block, and `Closer` to
free the memory. The backing memory is not garbage collected; losing all
references to a block without having called its `Close` method is a memory
leak, just like doing the same with `os.File` is a file descriptor leak.
However, a function obtained from a block can also spawn goroutines that use
the block's code, so it is impossible to know when a block is no longer in use
in the general case.

Once you're ready to execute memory in a Block, call its `Exec` method. After
doing so, any `Write` calls will panic, not return an error - trying to write
to executable memory is a programmer error, not a program error. If `Exec`
succeeds, you can call `Func` to obtain a function value. It is your
responsibility to ensure that the function address you provide points directly
to the beginning of a procedure that is fully ABI-compatible with the desired
function type, and that the block is not `Close`d while its code is being
executed.

Blocks are not synchronized. Calling any of their methods from multiple
goroutines requires explicit synchronization mechanisms. The exception to this
is that any number of goroutines may obtain functions from the block, as long
as `Exec` was synchronized before doing so and `Close` is not called until
after all goroutines have finished using the functions obtained from the block.

Incorrect use of unsafewx is characterized by a unique ability to cause
unrecoverable panics in the best case scenario. Take care. ðŸ™‚

## Supported Platforms

Currently, unsafewx has been tested (including with executing code) on
windows/amd64 and linux/amd64, and it should work on all Unix-like platforms.

It wouldn't be unwarranted to add more versions of `func Example` in
`wx_amd64_test.go` for more arches, but otherwise, unsafewx itself works
regardless of the value of `$GOARCH`.

Due to the extreme dependence on low-level runtime and ABI details, I'm not
certain that unsafewx will work with gccgo. The example test should cause an
access violation if it doesn't work in the expected way.

## Broken â€“ Do Not Use

I haven't tried it, but I'm fairly certain that if the garbage collector runs
while any goroutine is executing code in a Block, the runtime will panic. The
proper API for something like this would probably be to provide uintptr
addresses and then to use syscall.Syscall and friends to execute the code.
